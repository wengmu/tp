* `Console Display`: Provides immediate feedback, displaying success or failure messages based on the user’s command.
* `List Card`: Displays key information about contacts or properties, depending on the user's command.
* `Status Bar`: Displays whether contacts or properties are currently being shown.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addcontact n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addcontact n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/buyer` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times. Items can be used zero times if they are also wrapped in square brackets.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

2. `[JAR file location]/data/propertybook.json`

Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TheRealDeal will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br><br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TheRealDeal to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the application in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TheRealDeal home folder.
<br><br>
**Q**: Does TheRealDeal require internet connection?<br>
**A**: The application will only require internet connection if you want to access the User Guide. Every other command works without internet connection.
<br><br>
**Q**: Where is the data for TheRealDeal stored?<br>
**A**: Refer to [this](#editing-the-data-file) section to learn more.
<br><br>
**Q**: How do I back up my data?<br>
**A**: You can save a copy of the `addressbook.json` and `propertybook.json` to a back up location.
<br><br>
**Q**: Why isn't my command working for a contact/property that I have already input?<br>
**A**: Ensure that the contact/property you are affecting with the command is visible on the GUI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. **If you minimise the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimised, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimised Help Window.

3. **Contact names do not support special characters.** The current validation for contact names requires it to only consist of alphanumeric characters and spaces. The does not support names with special characters like `/` or `-` (e.g. `s/o`, `John-Mary`). This becomes a drawback for property agents who wish to store their contacts full name. The current workaround will be to only use alphanumeric characters (e.g. `son of` instead of `s/o`). Future improvements aim to support this functionality.

## Command Parameters
This table shows every parameter and prefix used in TheRealDeal.

**:information_source: Important:**<br>
If the command states that the prefix is optional e.g. <code>n/NAME [t/TAG]</code><br>
an empty parameter will be the same as not having the prefix<br>
e.g. <code>n/NAME t/</code> is the same as <code>n/NAME</code><br><br>
All parameters that expect integers must be entered as **plain digits** — without commas, dots, spaces, or any other separators.
