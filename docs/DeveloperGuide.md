### 2.1. Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#22-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#23-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#24-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#25-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#26-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact when a user runs `addproperty address/123 Orchard Rd postal/238888 ...` to add a new listing.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.2. UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`, `PropertyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` and `Property` object residing in the `Model`.

### 2.3. Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletecontact 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteContactCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it hands the raw text to a `UnifiedCommandParser`, which delegates to feature-specific parsers (e.g. `PropertyBookParser`) until one recognises the syntax (such as `DeleteContactCommandParser`).
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteContactCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, assuming the command is valid, the `UnifiedCommandParser` class will pass the command to the responsible parser from the two parser, `AddressBookParser` class and `PropertyBookParser` class.
* The selected parser class will create an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`, `DeleteContactCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 2.4. Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)
![ContactClassDiagram](images/ContactClassDiagram.png)
![PropertyClassDiagram](images/PropertyClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Contact` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueContactList` object).
* stores the property book data i.e., all `Property` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePropertyList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Contact`/`Property` objects (e.g., results of a filter query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>`/`ObservableList<Property>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### 2.5. Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, property book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from all of `AddressBookStorage`, `PropertyBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 2.6. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package. These classes provide utility functions that are used in many classes such as `StringUtil`, `ToStringBuilder` etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1. General Features

These features do not require any parameters and do not have a corresponding `Parser` class so is directly instantiated in `AddressBookParser`.

#### <u>Help Command</u> (`help`)
The `HelpCommand` opens up a separate window containing a link to the User Guide.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

##### Design Considerations
We designed the `HelpCommand` to let the user copy and navigate to the User Guide link directly. <br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:**<br>
Users can also press the <code>F1</code> key to open the help window
</div>

#### <u>List Command</u> (`list`)
The `ListCommand` resets all current filters and displays all the contacts/properties stored in the application.

##### Execution
The `ListCommand` calls the `Model` component to update the `FilteredList<Contact>` and `FilteredList<Property>` to show all of the `Contact` and `Property` in the list.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Important:**<br>
Users can switch to the list of contacts with: <code>filtercontact</code><br>
Users can switch to the list of properties with: <code>filterproperty</code>
</div>

##### Design Considerations
We designed the `ListCommand` to provide users with a quick and easy way to view all `Contact` and `Property`.

#### <u>Clear Command</u> (`clear`)
The `ClearCommand` allows users to delete all contacts and properties stored in the application

##### Execution
The `ClearCommand` sets the `Model` to be reference a new `AddressBook` and `PropertyBook` which effectively deletes all data that was previously stored.

##### Design Considerations
We designed the `ClearCommand` to let users easily remove any data stored in the application and start afresh.

#### <u>Exit Command</u> (`exit`)
The `ExitCommand` allows users to close the application.

##### Execution
The `ExitCommand` invokes the `handleExit` method in the `MainWindow` class which closes the UI (including the help window).

##### Design Considerations
As TheRealDeal is a CLI-based application, the `ExitCommand` can be used to exit the application using the CLI.

### 3.2. Contact management

All contacts are stored as `Contact` objects inside the `UniqueContactList` object under the `AdressBook` component. <br><br>
There is also an additional `FilteredList<Contact>` inside the `ModelManager` that stores the `Contact` that are displayed on the UI which is updated whenever the user issues a command that changes the UI.

#### <u>Add Command</u> (`addcontact`)
The `addcontact` command is designed to add a new contact to the address book.

Compulsory fields:
- Name
- Phone Number

Optional Fields:
- Address
- Email
- Minimum Budget
- Maximum Budget
- Tag
- Notes
- Status

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
The `AddContactCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the command input.
It utilises `ArgumentTokenizer` to split the input string based on defined prefixes (`PREFIX_NAME`, `PREFIX_PHONE`, etc)

The parser constructs a new `Contact` object that is wrapped inside a `AddContactCommand`.

Validation done:
- Ensures compulsory fields are present
- Ensures no duplicate fields are provided
- Ensures each individual field meets the constraints of that field (refer [here](#appendix-a-command-parameters) for the constraints)
- Unknown parameters provided will throw a `ParseException`

##### Execution
The `AddContactCommand` class generates the UUID for the `Contact` object and checks for duplicates in the address book before adding the new contact.

#### <u>Delete Command</u> (`deletecontact`)
The `deletecontact` command is designed to delete an existing contact from the address book, identified by their UUID.

Compulsory fields:
- UUID

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
The `DeleteContactCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the command input.
Documentation pending.

#### <u>Edit Command</u> (`editcontact`)
The `editcontact` command is designed to edit a contact in the address book, identified by their UUID.

Compulsory fields:
- UUID

Optional Fields:
- Name
- Phone Number
- Address
- Email
- Minimum Budget
- Maximum Budget
- Tag
- Notes
- Status

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
The `EditContactCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the command input.
It utilises `ArgumentTokenizer` to split the input string based on defined prefixes (`PREFIX_NAME`, `PREFIX_PHONE`, etc)
The UUID is also validated and parsed.

The parser creates an `EditContactDescriptor` object that stores the newly edited fields.

Validation done:
- Same validation done as `addcontact`
- At least one field must be edited
- New contact must not already be in the address book

##### Execution
The `EditContactCommand` executes by finding the target contact based on their UUID, creating an edited `Contact` object and updating the contact in the address book with the new details.

#### <u>Filter Contact Command</u> (`filtercontact`)
The `filtercontact` command filters the contacts in the address book based on the criteria given.

Optional Fields:
- Name
- Phone Number
- Address
- Email
- Minimum Budget
- Maximum Budget
- Tag
- Notes
- Status
- Limit
- Offset

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
The `FilterContactCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the command input. It utilises `ArgumentTokenizer` to split the input string based on defined prefixes (`PREFIX_NAME`, `PREFIX_PHONE`, etc) <br><br>
A `FilterContactPredicate` is created that encapsulates all the filter conditions and is used to test whether a contact matches the given filters.

Validation done:
- Same validation done as `addcontact`
- Proper data types and formats for numeric fields (e.g. budget, limit, offset)

##### Execution
`FilterContactCommand` applies the `FilterContactPredicate` over the existing filtered contact list and produces a list of matching contacts. It is also changed based on the `limit` and `offset` given.
The UI is then updated based on which contacts that match the predicate.

### 3.3. Property management

#### <u>Add Property Command</u> (`addproperty`)
The `addproperty` command adds a new property to the property book and links it to an existing owner contact.

Compulsory fields:
- Address (`a/`)
- Postal code (`postal/`)
- Price (`price/`)
- Type (`type/`)
- Status (`status/`)
- Bedroom count (`bed/`)
- Bathroom count (`bath/`)
- Floor area (`f/`)
- Listing type (`l/`)
- Owner UUID (`o/`)

Optional Fields:
- None

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
The `AddPropertyCommandParser` tokenises the raw arguments with `ArgumentTokenizer`, ensuring every compulsory prefix appears exactly once.
Each value is parsed via `ParserUtil` into the corresponding domain object (e.g. `PropertyAddress`, `Postal`, `Price`, `Owner`).

Validation done:
- Rejects missing or duplicate compulsory prefixes, raising a `ParseException` with `MESSAGE_USAGE`.
- Ensures each field satisfies its domain constraints (such as postal format, positive price and valid owner identifier).
- Trims surrounding whitespace so that inputs like `a/ 21 Sunset Way` are accepted.

##### Execution
`AddPropertyCommand#execute` requests a fresh UUID from `PropertyBook#generateNextUuid()`. It verifies the specified owner exists in the address book; if not, a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_OWNER_NOT_FOUND` is thrown.

A duplicate check is then performed, which compares address and postal pairs.
When all checks pass, the property is added, the UI shifts to the property view, and a success message (including the assigned UUID) is returned.

#### <u>Delete Property Command</u> (`deleteproperty`)
The `deleteproperty` command removes an existing property identified by its UUID from the property book.

Compulsory fields:
- Property UUID

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
`DeletePropertyCommandParser` converts the supplied argument into a `Uuid` using `ParserUtil.parsePropertyId`.

Validation done:
- Rejects blank input or extraneous tokens, wrapping the error with `MESSAGE_USAGE`.
- Ensures the UUID is a positive integer within bounds expected by the application.

##### Execution
`DeletePropertyCommand#execute` consults `Model#getFilteredPropertyList()`, which always reflects the latest property filtering applied in the UI (e.g. `list`, `filterproperty`).

For example, after running `filterproperty type/condo`, only the condo subset is searched—even if you subsequently switch to the contacts tab—until another property-filtering command updates the list.
If the supplied UUID is absent from that subset the command throws `MESSAGE_INVALID_PROPERTY_DISPLAYED_ID`; otherwise it deletes the property`, and update the UI accordingly.

#### <u>Filter Property Command</u> (`filterproperty`)
The `filterproperty` command filters the properties in the property book based on the criteria given.

Optional Fields:
- Address
- Postal
- Price
- Type
- Status
- Bedroom
- Bathroom
- Floor Area
- Listing
- Owner
- Limit
- Offset

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
The `FilterPropertyCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the command input. It utilises `ArgumentTokenizer` to split the input string based on defined prefixes (`PREFIX_PROPERTY_ADDRESS`, `PREFIX_PROPERTY_POSTAL`, etc) <br><br>
A `PropertyMatchesFilterPredicate` is created that encapsulates all the filter conditions and is used to test whether a property matches the given filters.

Validation done:
- Same validation done as `addproperty`
- Proper data types and formats for numeric fields (e.g. price, limit, offset)

##### Execution
`FilterPropertyCommand` applies the `PropertyMatchesFilterPredicate` over the existing filtered contact list and produces a list of matching contacts. It is also changed based on the `limit` and `offset` given.
The UI is then updated based on which properties that match the predicate.

#### <u>Mark Property as Sold Command</u> (`sold`)
The `sold` command finds properties by they UUID and changes the status of the property to unavailable.

Compulsory fields:
- UUID (using `p/` prefix)

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
The `MarkSoldCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the command input.

Validation done:
- No duplicate UUID is given
- No empty UUID is given
- Property with the given UUID exists

##### Execution
The `MarkSoldCommand` executes by retrieving the `Property` object for each UUID and creating a new `Property` object with the same attributes but with its `Status` as unavailable to replace the old `Property`.

#### <u>Mark Property as Unsold Command</u> (`unsold`)
The `unsold` command finds properties by they UUID and changes the status of the property to unavailable.

Compulsory fields:
- UUID (using `p/` prefix)

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
The `MarkUnsoldCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the command input.

Validation done:
- Same validation done as `sold`

##### Execution
The `MarkUnsoldCommand` executes by retrieving the `Property` object for each UUID and creating a new `Property` object with the same attributes but with its `Status` as unavailable to replace the old `Property`.

### 3.4. Contact–property linking

#### <u>Link Command</u> (`link`)
The `link` command is designed to link contacts in the address book to properties in the property book, as either buyers or sellers, each identified by their UUID.

Compulsory fields:
- Contact UUID
- Property UUID
- Relationship (buyer/seller)

Optional fields:
- Additional contact UUIDs
- Additional property UUIDs

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
The `LinkCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the command input.
It utilises `ArgumentTokenizer` to split the input string based on defined prefixes (`PREFIX_CONTACT_ID`, `PREFIX_PROPERTY_ID`, `PREFIX_LINK_RELATIONSHIP`)
Each UUID is also validated and parsed.

The parser creates an `LinkDescriptor` object that stores the parsed UUIDs and relationship.

Validation done:
- No duplicate relationship parameter

##### Execution
The `LinkCommand` executes by:
1. Finding the target contacts and properties based on their UUIDs
2. Ensuring none of the targets are already linked
3. Creating new edited `Contact` and `Property` objects with the updated relationship
4. Updating the contacts and properties in the address and property book with the new details.

#### <u>Unlink Command</u> (`unlink`)
The `unlink` command is designed to unlink contacts in the address book from properties in the property book, each identified by their UUID.

Compulsory fields:
- Contact UUID
- Property UUID

Optional fields:
- Additional contact UUIDs
- Additional property UUIDs

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
The `UnlinkCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the command input.
It utilises `ArgumentTokenizer` to split the input string based on defined prefixes (`PREFIX_CONTACT_ID`, `PREFIX_PROPERTY_ID`)
Each UUID is also validated and parsed.

The parser creates an `UnlinkDescriptor` object that stores the parsed UUIDs and relationship.

##### Execution
The `LinkCommand` executes by:
1. Finding the target contacts and properties based on their UUIDs
2. Ensuring all of the targets were previously linked
3. Creating new edited `Contact` and `Property` objects with buyer and seller relationships removed
4. Updating the contacts and properties in the address and property book with the new details.

#### <u>Show Contacts Command</u> (`showcontacts`)
The `showcontacts` command displays all contacts associated with a specific property by their ID.

Compulsory fields:
- Property ID

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
The `ShowContactsCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the command input.
It extracts the property ID from the raw input and validates it using `ParserUtil.parsePropertyId`.

The parser creates a `ShowContactsCommand` object with the validated property ID.

Validation done:
- Property ID must be a positive integer
- Property ID format must be valid (non-empty, numeric)

##### Execution
The `ShowContactsCommand` executes by:
1. Creating an `AssociatedWithPropertyPredicate` using the property ID and the full property list from the model
2. Applying this predicate to filter the contact list to show only contacts associated with the specified property
3. Switching the UI view to display the contact list
4. Returning a success message with the count of contacts found, or an error message with suggestions if no contacts are found

The predicate checks if a contact is associated with the property by:
- Checking if the contact owns the property (via the property's owner field)
- Checking if the contact is a buyer of the property (via buyingContactIds)
- Checking if the contact is a seller of the property (via sellingContactIds)

#### <u>Show Properties Command</u> (`showproperties`)
The `showproperties` command displays all properties associated with a specific contact by their ID.

Compulsory fields:
- Contact ID

##### Parsing and Validating User Input
The `ShowPropertiesCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the command input.
It extracts the contact ID from the raw input and validates it using `ParserUtil.parseContactId`.

The parser creates a `ShowPropertiesCommand` object with the validated contact ID.

Validation done:
- Contact ID must be a positive integer
- Contact ID format must be valid (non-empty, numeric)

##### Execution
The `ShowPropertiesCommand` executes by:
1. Creating an `AssociatedWithContactPredicate` using the contact ID
2. Applying this predicate to filter the property list to show only properties associated with the specified contact
3. Switching the UI view to display the property list via `MainWindow.getInstance().showPropertiesView()`
4. Returning a success message with the count of properties found, or an error message with suggestions if no properties are found

The predicate checks if a property is associated with the contact by using the `Property.isAssociatedWith(contactUuid)` method, which verifies:
- If the contact owns the property (via the property's owner field)
- If the contact is a buyer of the property (via buyingContactIds)
- If the contact is a seller of the property (via sellingContactIds)

## Appendix: Command Parameters
This table shows every parameter and prefix used in TheRealDeal.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Important:**<br>
If the command states that the prefix is optional e.g. <code>n/NAME [t/TAG]</code><br>
an empty parameter will be the same as not having the prefix<br>
e.g. <code>n/NAME t/</code> is the same as <code>n/NAME</code><br><br>
All parameters that expect integers must be entered as **plain digits** — without commas, dots, spaces, or any other separators.
</div>

### Contact Management
These are prefixes for purely contact related commands.

## Appendix: Glossary

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS.
* **CLI**: Command Line Interface, a text-based interface that processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text.
* **GUI**: Graphical User Interface, a form of user interface through which users interact with electronic devices via visual indicator representations.
* **API**: Application Programming Interface, specifies the interface through which software and other programs interact.
* **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, a text-based data storage format used to store the data of the application.
* **Command**: A specific instruction given to TheRealDeal to perform a certain action, like adding a new contact to the list.
* **Contact**: A domain entity representing a client (buyer or seller) in TheRealDeal system.
* **Prefix**: A unique identifier (e.g., n/, p/, a/) that tells the parser what type of parameter follows.
* **Property**: A domain entity representing a real estate listing with attributes like address, price, type, and availability.
* **ID**: A unique identifier automatically generated by the application to identify contacts and properties. Displayed in the GUI and used in commands. Internally implemented as the `Uuid` class in the codebase.
* **Buyer**: A contact who is interested in purchasing a property. Multiple buyers can be linked to the same property to track all interested parties during negotiations. Being linked as a buyer indicates interest, not completed purchase. Use the `sold` command to mark a property as unavailable once the sale is finalised. 
* **Seller**: A contact role indicating intent to sell properties.
* **Owner**: The contact who legally owns a property, specified via the `o/` parameter when adding properties. Each property must have exactly one owner.
* **Sold**: A property marked as no longer available, achieved using the `sold` command. Sets the property status to "unavailable".
* **Unsold**: A property marked as available for transactions, achieved using the `unsold` command. Sets the property status to "available".
* **Available**: A property status indicating the property is currently on the market and can be sold.
* **Unavailable**: A property status indicating the property has been sold and is no longer on the market.
* **Active**: A contact status indicating the contact is currently engaged and actively working with the agent.
* **Inactive**: A contact status indicating the contact is not currently engaged with the agent or has paused their property search.
* **Relationship**: The type of link between a contact and property, specified using the `link` command as either "buyer" or "seller".

## Appendix: Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

##### Initial launch
To simulate:<br>
- Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder and double-click the jar file

Expected:<br>
- Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts.
- The window size may not be optimum.

##### Saving window preferences
To simulate:<br>
- Resize the window to an optimum size.
- Move the window to a different location.
- Close the window.
- Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.

Expected:<br>
The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Filtering and Switching Contact List (`filtercontact`)

##### Switching to contact list view

Command: `filtercontact`

To simulate:<br>
- Run the command while on any list (e.g., property list).

Expected:<br>
- The view switches to the contact list.
- Status message confirms the change.

Variations:<br>
- Run multiple times; the second run should have no visible change.
- Switch from property to contact and back to confirm toggling works.

##### Listing the full contact list

Command: `list`

To simulate:<br>
- Ensure you are on the contact list page.
- If not, run `filtercontact` to switch to the contact list.
- Run `list`.

Expected:<br>
- The full contact list is displayed.
- Status message shows success.

Variations:<br>
- Try `list` after filtering to confirm it resets filters.
- Repeat after editing or deleting a contact to confirm it reflects the latest state.

##### Filtering by name and email

Command: `filtercontact n/Alice e/example.com`

To simulate:<br>
- Ensure multiple contacts exist.
- Run the command above.

Expected:<br>
- Lists only contacts whose names include “Alice” and emails include “example.com.”
- Status message shows number of contacts displayed.

Variations:<br>
- Add more conditions (e.g., `t/buyer`) to confirm multi-prefix filtering.
- Test with mixed casing (e.g., `n/aLiCe`) to confirm case-insensitive matching.

##### Filtering by tag with limits
Command: `filtercontact t/buyer limit/10 offset/1`

To simulate:<br>
- Ensure contact list contains multiple tagged `buyer`.
- Run the command above.

Expected:<br>
- Shows up to 10 contacts, skipping the first one.
- Status message indicates count and offset.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

Team size: 5

1. **Allow special characters to be used in contact names.** The current validation for contact names requires it to only consist of alphanumeric characters and spaces. The does not support names with special characters like `/` or `-` (e.g. `s/o`, `John-Mary`). Future improvements aim to support this functionality.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Appendix: Effort

#### Difficulty Level and Effort Required
This project was significantly harder and took more time than the individual project. TheRealDeal is the first team-based software engineering project for all of us. Most of us had prior experience with a two-man project for NUS Orbital (CP2106) but this group project made it very difficult to split the workload and coordinate features.
<br><br>
Unlike AB3 which handles only `Contact`, this application handles both `Contact` and `Property` each with their distinct commands, models and UI components. This required a clear separation and linking between contacts and properties. Furthermore, this project was made significantly harder with the need of a comprehensive User Guide and Developer Guide.
<br><br>
A high proportion of effort was saved through reuse of AB3. Such examples include the `ReadOnlyPropertyBook` and `PropertyBook` which takes reference from `ReadOnlyAddressBook` and `AddressBook` which made it easier to implement the `Property` class as AB3 was easily extendable.

#### Challenges Faced
- More comprehensive input validation and testing because it is a CLI-based application
- Coordinating and agreeing on a use case and format of a command as many changes were made week after week
- Implementing complex parsers due to the presence of compulsory parameters, optional parameters or multi-word parameters

#### Achievements of the Project
- Extensive refactoring of AB3 with over 15,000 more lines of code with a high test coverage
- Comprehensive features that extend AB3 into a real estate management application
- Team collaboration and Software Engineering Principles (Git workflow, Issue tracking, Single Level of Abstraction, Logging)
- Extensive User Guide and Developer Guide with the aid of (Unified Modelling Language) UML diagrams

## Appendix: Software Engineering Practices
Common Software Engineering Practices (SEP) has been carried out throughout this project. Testing is done automatically after each code change and is also deployed to GitHub at the same time. <br>

SEP has been carried out as follows:
1. Unit Testing and Test Coverage Analysis
2. Integrated GitHub tests (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)
3. Version Control (GitHub)

#### Unit Testing and Test Coverage Analysis
Unit testing has been carried out in the form of [JUnit](https://docs.junit.org/current/user-guide/) tests of almost all Java classes. There are currently over 600 different test cases which can be seen [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/test). <br> <br>
Test coverage refers to the extent in which the code is tested, and we have utilised [CodeCov](https://about.codecov.io/) to measure our code coverage. The code coverage can be seen [here](https://app.codecov.io/github/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp). <br> <br>
As of v1.5, the test coverage is above 80%.

#### Integrated GitHub tests (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)
We have utilised _**GitHub Actions**_ to carry out automated testing on Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu devices on every push or pull request. Through these tests, feature branches can be tested before they are merged to the master branch, which ensures that regressions are caught early and are not deployed.
The workflow file used can be seen [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/3fef75e58132ad7d04d4d2cfef54b701466e2f22/.github/workflows/gradle.yml).

#### Version Control (GitHub)
We have carried out version control in the form of GitHub Releases which can be seen [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/releases).
